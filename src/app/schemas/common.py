    Pydantic schema for pagination and filtering parameters.

    This schema is designed to handle standard query parameters

    Attributes:
        limit (int): The maximum number of records to return.
            - Default: 100
            - Constraints: Must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100.

            - Default: 0
            - Constraints: Must be greater than or equal to 0.
