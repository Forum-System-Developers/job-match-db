**Project Rephera** is a backend web application built using the FASTApi framework for creating a job matching platform. It provides a RESTful API for user authentication, job and applications posting, applicant and company user management, and role-based permissions.

The **api** app can be found <a href='https://github.com/Forum-System-Developers/job-match'>here</a>.

The **frontend** app can be found <a href='https://github.com/Forum-System-Developers/job-match-frontend'>here</a>.

## Features
- **Job Advertisement Management**: Create, read and update job ads.
- **Job Application Management**: Create, read and update job applications.
- **Company profile Management**: Manage companies and their job advertisements.
- **Professional Profile Management**: Manage applicants and their applications.

## Installation

To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or later
- Pyenv

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Forum-System-Developers/job-match-db.git
   cd job-match-db
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   - For UNIX based systems run `make init_mac` in the console
   - For Windows users run the `init_win.ps1` file

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file with the following content:
   ```bash
   cp src/.env_template .env
   # Open .env and set the required configurations (e.g., database URL)
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python src/run_server.py
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:7999`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at:
- **Swagger UI**: [http://127.0.0.1:7999/swagger](http://127.0.0.1:7999/swagger)
- **ReDoc**: [http://127.0.0.1:7999/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:7999/redoc)

You can also use tools like Postman or `curl` to test the API endpoints.

```

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest tests
```

This will run all tests in the `tests/` directory. Ensure that your `.env` file or test configuration uses a separate test database to avoid modifying production data.
